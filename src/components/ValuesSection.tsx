                HealExpress was born from a simple yet powerful realization: in India's vast landscape, 
                quality emergency medical care should be accessible to everyone, everywhere. Founded in 2020, 
                we started with a mission to bridge the gap between life-threatening emergencies and timely medical help.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a small team with big dreams has grown into India's most trusted emergency 
                medical service platform. Today, we serve over 2,00,000 families across 500+ districts, 
                but our core mission remains unchanged: bringing hope to life when it matters most.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our journey is marked by countless lives saved, families reunited, and communities strengthened. 
                Every ambulance dispatched, every call answered, every life touched â€” they all contribute to 
                our story of compassion, innovation, and unwavering commitment to serving humanity.
